# Psychic-Game

This JavaScript file and html file implement a game in which the user presses a letter key on the keyboard to try to determine the letter key that the computer selects. A game session ends when the user presses the correct letter key (a win situation), or after the user enters 9 unsuccessful guesses (a loss situation).

The number of user wins and losses is tracked. In a game session, the history of the user's selections is displayed, and the number of remaining guesses available to the user is displayed.
